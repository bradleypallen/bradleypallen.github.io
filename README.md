# Bradley P. Allen's minimalistic Markdown home page

This is my very minimalist approach to publishing a single-page
[home page](https://www.bradleypallen.org/bradleypallen_org_md/)
using Markdown and Github Pages. Idiosyncratic, but easily reproducible, and
it avoids the complexity of static site publishing tools like Hugo or Jekyll.
