In this work, we present an approach to answer these directly over text data without storing results in a database. We specifically look at the case of knowledge bases where queries are over entities and the relations between them. Our approach combines distributed query answering (e.g. Triple Pattern Fragments) with models built for extractive question answering. Importantly, by applying distributed querying answering we are able to simplify the model learning problem. We train models for a large portion (572) of the relations within Wikidata and achieve an average 0.70 F1 measure across all models. We also present a systematic method to construct the necessary training data for this task from knowledge graphs and describe a prototype implementation.","tags":null,"title":"End-to-End Learning for Answering Structured Queries Directly over Text","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1476345600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1476345600,"objectID":"c24aac5ef2def39b5b35a52a8c557a61","permalink":"https://bradleypallen.github.io/talk/dc-2016-keynote/","publishdate":"2020-05-10T23:41:07-07:00","relpermalink":"/talk/dc-2016-keynote/","section":"talk","summary":"At the DC-2016 conference in Copenhagen, Brad gave a keynote sharing his thoughts on how metadata standards may need to evolve in a future where machines, and not just people, are readers.","tags":[],"title":"The Role of Metadata in the Second Machine Age","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Paul Groth, Sujit Pal, Darin McBeath, Brad Allen, Ron Daniel"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1451606400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1451606400,"objectID":"ff47a42b568ebf645b194859c9309fa9","permalink":"https://bradleypallen.github.io/publication/groth-2016-applying/","publishdate":"2020-05-11T01:58:17.228736Z","relpermalink":"/publication/groth-2016-applying/","section":"publication","summary":"Manually created large scale ontologies are useful for organizing, searching, and repurposing content ranging from scientific papers and medical guidelines to images. However, maintenance of such ontologies is expensive. In this paper, we investigate the use of universal schemas (Riedel et al., 2013) as a mechanism for ontology maintenance. We apply this approach on top of two unique data sources: 14 million full-text scientific articles and chapters, plus a 1 million concept handcurated medical ontology. We show that using a straightforward matrix factorization algorithm one can achieve 0.7 F1 measure on a link prediction task in this environment. Link prediction results can be used to suggest new relation types and relation type synonyms coming from the literature as well as predict specific new relation instances in the ontology.","tags":null,"title":"Applying Universal Schemas for Domain Specific Ontology Expansion","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Bradley P Allen","Cormac Twomey","John B Jensen"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1165276800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1165276800,"objectID":"20abc010ae085ab7a379089bcd2a101a","permalink":"https://bradleypallen.github.io/publication/allen-2006-method/","publishdate":"2020-05-11T01:58:17.223944Z","relpermalink":"/publication/allen-2006-method/","section":"publication","summary":"One embodiment of the present invention provides a system that uses faceted metadata to facilitate navigation through information resources. During operation, the system receives a query from a client at a server. The system then performs the query on metadata, wherein the metadata contains facets that describe characteristics of the information resources. While performing the query, the system generates results that identify information resources that satisfy the query. Next, the system constructs a response containing the results, the query, and suggestions on how to refine the query. The system then sends the response to the client, thereby allowing the client to refine the query. In this way, the client and server can work together in a stateless manner to re?ne the query without having to maintain state information about the query on the server.","tags":null,"title":"Method and apparatus for using faceted metadata to navigate through information resources","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Bradley P Allen","Jeffrey M Greif","David L Adam","John B Jensen","Michael W Lo","Cormac Twomey"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":961459200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":961459200,"objectID":"9a043073a4a01cb037d749a9de7ff9ac","permalink":"https://bradleypallen.github.io/publication/allen-2000-online/","publishdate":"2020-05-11T01:58:17.218215Z","relpermalink":"/publication/allen-2000-online/","section":"publication","summary":"One embodiment of the present invention provides a system for making predictions about data records from an incoming stream of data records. This system operates by discovering predictive relationships in an online manner between fields in records in the incoming stream of data records as the incoming stream of data records is received. These predic tive relationships can used to predict values in fields based on other field values in the same record. This facilitates cleansing of data by allowing transaction values to be validated based upon predictions made from other field values in the same transaction record. It also allows missing field values to be predicted based upon the other field values. A variation of this embodiment provides for filtering transaction records based upon discovered predictive relationships and routing the transaction records to other servers in real-time. Another embodiment forms association rules between fields in records in the incoming s of records, and outputs these association rules for viewing by a human decision-maker. In another embodiment, the present invention comprises a server with an online predictive memory that can be incorporated into a heterogeneous network as a server. This embodiment is scalable and can be incorporated into an existing network with minimal integration effort. Note that the underlying model for this system continuously adapts to changes in the incoming stream of records over time without the need for any human intervention.","tags":null,"title":"Online predictive memory","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Bradley P Allen","S Daniel Lee"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":849571200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":849571200,"objectID":"a89d3ad4863d1696b9ea552df63ef1da","permalink":"https://bradleypallen.github.io/publication/allen-1996-case/","publishdate":"2020-05-11T01:58:17.219264Z","relpermalink":"/publication/allen-1996-case/","section":"publication","summary":"A case-based reasoning system which is smoothly integrated into a rule-based reasoning system, thus coordinating case based reasoning techniques and rule-based reasoning tech niques in a unified automated reasoning system, in which an automated processor may proceed by inferential reasoning on the facts of the problem and the cases by means of rule-based reasoning techniques or based on procedural directives supplied by a human programmer, and may select the case which is the best match for the problem, but may act differently from the precise action prescribed for that case.

The five-step process entails the presentation, in which a description of the problem is input; retrieval, in which the closest-matching cases are retrieved by the system from a database of cases, or case base; adaptation, in which the problem and closest-matching cases are used to generate a solution; validation, in which the solution is validated using feedback from the user or environment; and update, in which the solution is added to the case base for use in future problem solving. CBR is seen by some researchers as better suited to knowledge-based system (KBS) design than rule- or model-based techniques.
