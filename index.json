In this work, we present an approach to answer these directly over text data without storing results in a database. We specifically look at the case of knowledge bases where queries are over entities and the relations between them. Our approach combines distributed query answering (e.g. Triple Pattern Fragments) with models built for extractive question answering. Importantly, by applying distributed querying answering we are able to simplify the model learning problem. We train models for a large portion (572) of the relations within Wikidata and achieve an average 0.70 F1 measure across all models. We also present a systematic method to construct the necessary training data for this task from knowledge graphs and describe a prototype implementation.","tags":null,"title":"End-to-End Learning for Answering Structured Queries Directly over Text","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Bradley Paul Allen"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1476316800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1476316800,"objectID":"79923a2dd313fac7f15939d7bc94ff33","permalink":"https://bradleypallen.github.io/publication/allen-2016-role/","publishdate":"2020-05-11T01:58:17.231642Z","relpermalink":"/publication/allen-2016-role/","section":"publication","summary":"Much of Elsevier's work in the digitization of scholarly content has involved the adoption of metadata standards, of which Dublin Core and its related vocabularies have been central.

We apply this approach on top of two unique data sources: 14 million full-text scientific articles and chapters, plus a 1 million concept handcurated medical ontology.
