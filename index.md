| [![A YouTube video of Brad's CHM oral history](resources/images/chm_oral_history.png)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2yKJ1CA9FYU) | I'm [**a retired technology executive and serial entrepreneur**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bpallen) who is currently [**a doctoral candidate in the University of Amsterdam's Intelligent Data Engineering Lab**](https://indelab.org/). Previously, I was Chief Architect at Elsevier, and before that, founder/CTO at three startups in the Los Angeles area, achieving successful exits in two of the three. I began my career during the 1980s as [**one of the first knowledge engineers of the expert systems era**](https://archive.computerhistory.org/resources/access/text/2020/04/102740341-05-01-acc.pdf), after earning a BS in Applied Mathematics at Carnegie Mellon University.  |

Using [**natural language to specify meaning in formal languages**](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.03749), we can build [**neurosymbolic systems that leverage LLMs' parametric knowledge without sacrificing logical rigor**](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.09751). | 
| [![A YouTube video of Brad's 15 September 2020 talk for the Harvard Data Science Initiative](resources/images/hdsi-industry-seminar-2020-09-15.png)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cK3yKFhDyxs) | A major part of my commercial work was as [**an architect of data platforms for business transformation**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cK3yKFhDyxs). In this presentation to the Harvard Data Science Initiative on 15 September 2020, I discuss data science in practice at Elsevier, detailing how data science transformed our approach to scientific content and led to the delivery of new products to Elsevier's customers. |
| [![Brad unmolding a timpano](resources/images/nye_dinner_2020_12_31.png)](https://youtu.be/AoupoSOtZs8?feature=shared) | I am at other times an amateur astronomer, a mountaineer, and a home cook. Of late, there's been a bit more of the third of these activities than the other two. Here I am unmolding my version of a timpano, inspired (as so many others) by the one featured in Stanley Tucci's film "Big Night". |
